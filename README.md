I'm currently working on rebuilding Resolve's built-in Film-Look-LUTs.
Although I like really them, I often find myself struggling with their strong contrast as well as their integrated display transform.
My goal is to make them suitable for a scene-referred workflow (Arri Log-C3) and give them my own little color twist.
At the moment I'm rebuilding the Fuji 3513 DI, the Kodak 2383 will be next.
